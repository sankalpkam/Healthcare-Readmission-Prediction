# 🏥 Patient Readmission Prediction Dashboard – Power BI + Python

## 📌 Problem Statement
Reducing 30-day patient readmissions is a priority for healthcare providers to improve patient care and reduce penalties. This project predicts patient readmission and presents insights using Power BI.

---

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) for data prep and modeling
- Power BI for dashboarding
- Dataset: `final_readmission_dataset.csv`

---

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- Total Readmission Rate
- Key Drivers: Age, Hypertension, LOS, BMI
- Gender-based trends
- Discharge Destination outcomes
- Medication count vs Readmission
- Actual vs Predicted analysis

---

## 🧪 ML Model
A Logistic Regression model was trained to predict readmission using cleaned patient data.

---

## 📂 Files Included
- `final_readmission_dataset.csv` – Final dataset with predictions
- `readmission_dashboard.pbix` – Power BI file (create using guide below)
- `README.md` – This documentation

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Load `final_readmission_dataset.csv` in Power BI
2. Use Data View to define data types:
   - Age, BMI, LOS as numeric
   - Gender, Diabetes, etc. as categorical
3. Build visuals listed in the project brief
4. Publish to Power BI service or export as PDF
